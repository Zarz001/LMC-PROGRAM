# LMC-PROGRAM
An LMC program written in assembly language that accepts as input a quadruple of non-negative integers (a, b, c, x),
outputs the value of the quadratic expression
洧녩 + 洧녪洧논 + 洧녫洧논2
and then halts.
If the value of 洧녩 + 洧녪洧논 + 洧녫洧논2
is greater than 999, your program must output a 999 and then halt
